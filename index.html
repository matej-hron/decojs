            <h2>Why Learn Decompression Theory?</h2>
            <p>
                Every diver relies on decompression models to stay safe underwater. Whether you're using dive tables, 
                a dive computer, or planning software, these tools are all built on the same fundamental principles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding how your body absorbs and releases inert gases helps you become a safer, more confident diver. 
                These interactive lessons will take you from the basics to advanced concepts, step by step.

                This is an educational resource for divers who want to understand the science behind their dive computers. 
                All visualizations are based on the <strong>Bühlmann ZH-L16</strong> decompression model, one of the most 
                widely used algorithms in recreational and technical diving.
